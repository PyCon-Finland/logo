# PyCon Finland logo

Created with approval from the
[PSF Trademarks Committee](https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/), by drawing the
[Finnish flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Finland) inside the
["two snakes" Python logo](https://www.python.org/community/logos/) using
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

To make sure there's enough contrast to see the logo shape, use the logo against a light
background, or add an additional outset white separating line.
